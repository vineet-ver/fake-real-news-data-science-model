# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **Fake News Detection** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
It aims to classify news articles as **real or fake** based on their textual content.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words**.
- Implementation of various ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation with **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**.
- Final prediction system to classify unseen news articles.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy`, `pandas` (data handling)
  - `scikit-learn` (ML algorithms & evaluation)
  - `nltk` / `spacy` (NLP preprocessing)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (visualization)

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains news articles labeled as **real** or **fake**.  
Typical structure:
- `title` → headline of the news
- `text` → body of the article
- `label` → (1 = Real, 0 = Fake)

👉 Public datasets like [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news) or [LIAR Dataset](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip) can be used.

## ⚡ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vineet-ver/fake-real-news-data-science-model.git
   cd fake-news-detectiono
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fake_real_news_detection.ipynb
   ```

4. (Optional) To predict on custom input:
   ```python
   news = "Your custom news text here"
   prediction = model.predict([news])
   print("Real" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Fake")
   ```

- Naive Bayes achieved **XX% accuracy**
- Random Forest achieved **XX% accuracy**
- SVM achieved **XX% accuracy**

(Replace XX with your actual results)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use deep learning models (**LSTMs, BiLSTMs, Transformers**).
- Deploy as a **Flask/Django Web App** or **FastAPI REST API**.
- Integrate with a **browser extension** to detect fake news in real-time.
